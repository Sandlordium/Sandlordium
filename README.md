# Sandbot
Code for my discord bot. Discord here: https://discord.gg/ArrY3Jr

Those three files have all the code for this bot. I am not going to give out the token because of the power that would give people over my bot. If you want to know how I made this, then check out the guide here:https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz

This is kept running via Uptime robot found here: https://uptimerobot.com and the flask framework.
